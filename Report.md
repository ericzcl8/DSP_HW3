# HW2 / Image Filtering and Corner Detection

## Overview
The project is related to corner detection. By digital signal processing, corners in an image can be found out and labeled as red circles on the image. To do so, we use gradient filters and a Gaussian filter, calculate "corner response function" (R), transform R to a binary image,  and finally find local maximums, where corners appear.


## Implementation
